### The Qiskit Fall Fest is a collection of quantum computing events taking place on college campuses worldwide. Every Fall Fest event is planned and executed by students on each campus, with assistance from the entire IBM Quantum team. Throughout the month of September, student leaders collaborate with IBM to design and plan their events, which are then held in October. The events range from technical hackathons to beginner-friendly challenges, all with the goal of assisting in the growth of the local community.
